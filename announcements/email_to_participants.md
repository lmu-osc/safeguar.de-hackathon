Subject: Three days until we meet at the Safeguar.de Hackathon

Dear participants,

in three days, we will meet at the OSC/Safeguar.de Hackathon in Munich. We are looking forward to seeing you there!

The interest was amazing, and we are happy to announce that more than 40 people from different disciplines, from students to professor, expressed their interest to participate. We will be able to provide you with a lot of hardware, but please bring your own laptop if you can. If you have old hardware that you would like to donate, please bring it along.

Here are the details:


üóìÔ∏è 2025-08-07, 16:00 - 19:00
üìç Leopoldstr. 13, 80802 M√ºnchen (U3/U6 Giselastr.), Raum 3232 ([Raumfinder](https://www.lmu.de/raumfinder/index.html#/building/bw0601/map?room=060302232_))

The room is in House 3, second floor.

The event is concepted as an in-person event. But as some are not able to come, we try to setup a Zoom meeting where we stream the opening informational talk by our guest Henrik Sch√∂nemann. But this remote snippet does not replace the in-person event, so please be there if you can manage to do so.

Generally, this will be a very informal and hands-on event. So if you can't manage to be there in time, don't worry, just come by when you can. We will start with a short introduction and then we will split into groups to work on different tasks. You can join any group that you like, or just hack on your own project. Here's the [tentative schedule](https://github.com/lmu-osc/safeguar.de-hackathon/blob/main/Schedule.md).

See you soon,
Felix & Philipp
