**Subject**: Safeguarding Research Data Hackathon (Aug 7)

---

Dear colleagues,

the Trump administration has aggressively removed scientific and governmental research data from public access, purging thousands of web pages and datasets related to climate, health, demographics, LGBTQ + issues, and more — silently erasing vital knowledge that underpins scientific progress.

While some European institutions start backing up at-risk rsearch data, the data rescue movement is driven by grassroots efforts like the "Data Rescue Project" and the "Safeguarding Research" initiative, who have mobilized volunteers, librarians, and scientists to download and archive these resources before they are lost forever.

The LMU Open Science Center is running a hackathon where we support, hands-on, these data rescue projects.

We aim to ...

- install a BitTorrent client on participants’ machines to begin seeding and safeguarding research datasets
- repurpose old hardware — such as 2.5" HDDs, Raspberry Pis, or laptops - by installing Linux and using them as dedicated rescue nodes
- enhace documentation and develop one-click installation scripts to make node deployment easy across systems

A note: While a hackathon is often focused on technical solutions, this event is explicitly open to all interested people. Parts of the hackathon are indeed software and hardware focused, but we also need people who can help with outreach, documentation, and coordination. So if you have ideas or skills in these areas, please join us!

Let’s work together to preserve scientific knowledge and build a resilient, community-powered data infrastructure.

**If you are interested in joining the project (regardless if you can attend this specific hackathon or not) please add yourself to this short online survey: TODO LINK.**

(You can also show up spontaenously at the hackathon, but it would be great to know how many people to expect.)

Best regards,
Felix Schönbrodt
