**Subject**: Data Under Threat — Join the Data Rescue Hackathon (Aug 7)

---

Dear colleagues,

the Trump administration has aggressively removed scientific and governmental research data from public access, purging thousands of web pages and datasets related to climate, health, demographics, LGBTQ + issues, and more — silently erasing vital knowledge that underpins scientific progress.

While some European institutions start backing up at-risk research data, the data rescue movement is driven by grassroots efforts like the "Data Rescue Project" and the "Safeguarding Research & Culture" initiative, who have mobilized volunteers, librarians, and scientists to download and archive these resources before they are lost forever.

## Join the LMU Open Science Center Safeguar.de Hackathon

At this hands-on event, we welcome **Henrik Schönemann** (HU Berlin), an initiator of safeguar.de, for an ignition talk. In the practical part, we will directly support the data rescue efforts:

- **Learn & Build**: Install a BitTorrent client on your own machine to seed and safeguard critical research datasets. Scrape at-risk data sets.
- **Repurpose Old Hardware**: Turn old 2.5" HDDs, Raspberry Pis, or laptops into dedicated data rescue nodes by installing Linux and setting up archiving tools.
- **Improve Tools & Docs**: Write better documentation and develop one-click installation scripts to simplify deployment on any system.

**When**: Thursday, 7 August 2025, 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.

**Where**: Leopoldstr. 13, 80802 München (exact location will be announced to registered participants)

## Open to Everyone — Not Just Coders

While some parts are technical, we welcome everyone to contribute to: Outreach, documentation, coordination, creative ideas.

Let’s work together to preserve scientific knowledge and build a resilient, community-powered data infrastructure. You can contribute to the project by ...

- Donating old hardware and/or
- Attending the Hackathon
- Participating in the discussions
