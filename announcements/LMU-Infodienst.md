**Subject**: Data Under Threat ‚Äî Join the Data Rescue Hackathon (Aug 7)

---

Dear colleagues,

the Trump administration has aggressively removed scientific and governmental research data from public access, purging thousands of web pages and datasets related to climate, health, demographics, LGBTQ‚ÄØ+‚ÄØissues, and more ‚Äî silently erasing vital knowledge that underpins scientific progress.

While some European institutions start backing up at-risk research data, the data rescue movement is driven by grassroots efforts like the "Data Rescue Project" and the "Safeguarding Research & Culture" initiative, who have mobilized volunteers, librarians, and scientists to download and archive these resources before they are lost forever.

## üöÄ Join the LMU Open Science Center Safeguar.de Hackathon

At this hands-on event, we welcome **Henrik Sch√∂nemann** (HU Berlin), an initiator of safeguar.de, for an ignition talk. In the practical part, we will directly support the data rescue efforts. Here‚Äôs what we aim to do together:

- **Learn & Build**: Install a BitTorrent client on your own machine to seed and safeguard critical research datasets.
- **Repurpose Old Hardware**: Turn old 2.5" HDDs, Raspberry Pis, or laptops into dedicated data rescue nodes by installing Linux and setting up archiving tools.
- **Improve Tools & Docs**: Write better documentation and develop one-click installation scripts to simplify deployment on any system.

**When**: Thursday, 7.8.2025, 16:00 - 19:00 

**Where**: Leopoldstr. 13, 80802 Munich (exact location will be announced to registered participants)

## ü§ù Open to Everyone ‚Äî Not Just Coders

While some parts are technical, we welcome everyone to contribute to: Outreach, documentation, coordination, creative ideas.

*Let‚Äôs work together to preserve scientific knowledge and build a resilient, community-powered data infrastructure.*

**You can contribute to the project by ...**

- Donating old hardware and/or
- Attending the Hackathon
- Participating in the discussions
