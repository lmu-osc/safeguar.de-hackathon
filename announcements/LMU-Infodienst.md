**Subject**: Data Under Threat ‚Äî Join the Data Rescue Hackathon (Aug 7)

---

Dear colleagues,

the Trump administration has aggressively removed scientific and governmental research data from public access, purging thousands of web pages and datasets related to climate, health, demographics, LGBTQ‚ÄØ+‚ÄØissues, and more ‚Äî silently erasing vital knowledge that underpins scientific progress.

While some European institutions start backing up at-risk rsearch data, the data rescue movement is driven by grassroots efforts like the "Data Rescue Project" and the "Safeguarding Research" initiative, who have mobilized volunteers, librarians, and scientists to download and archive these resources before they are lost forever.

## üöÄ Join the LMU Open Science Center Hackathon

At this hands-on event, we will directly support these data rescue efforts. Here‚Äôs what we aim to do together:

- **Learn & Build**: Install a BitTorrent client on your own machine to seed and safeguard critical research datasets.
- **Repurpose Old Hardware**: Turn old 2.5" HDDs, Raspberry Pis, or laptops into dedicated data rescue nodes by installing Linux and setting up archiving tools.
- **Improve Tools & Docs**: Write better documentation and develop one-click installation scripts to simplify deployment on any system.

**When**: Thursday, 7.8.2025, 16:00 - 19:00 

**Where**: Leopoldstr. 13, 80802 Munich, room 3322

## ü§ù Open to Everyone ‚Äî Not Just Coders

While some parts are technical, we welcome everyone to contribute to: Outreach, Documentation, Coordination, Creative ideas.


Let‚Äôs work together to preserve scientific knowledge and build a resilient, community-powered data infrastructure.

**If you are interested in joining the project (regardless if you can attend this specific hackathon or not) please add yourself to this short online survey: TODO LINK.**

(You can also join spontaneously, but signing up helps us plan, and registered participants might receive some follow-up information!)

Best regards,
