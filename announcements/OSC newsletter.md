# Research Data Rescue Hackathon - August 7

The Trump administration is aggressively deleting scientific and governmental research data, purging thousands of web pages and datasets related to climate, health, demographics, LGBTQ + issues, and more — silently erasing vital knowledge that underpins scientific progress.

Grassroot initiatives like the "Data Rescue Project" and "Safeguarding Research & Culture" have mobilized volunteers, librarians, and scientists to download and archive these resources before they are lost forever.

We are running a hackathon which will directly support these efforts: Join the global coalition of data rescuers by turning your own laptop into a Research Data Rescue Node, scraping at-risk data sets, and breathing new life into your old HDD as part of the global, decentralised network.

📦 Data Rescue Hackathon — 7.8.2025, 16:00–19:00
📍 Leopoldstr. 13, Room 3322, Munich
🍕 Free pizza!

Whether you’re a coder, a librarian, social media enthusiast, or just curious — everyone can contribute.
