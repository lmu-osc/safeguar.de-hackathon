Dear OSC fellows,

the Trump administration has aggressively removed scientific and governmental research data from public access, purging thousands of web pages and datasets related to climate, health, demographics, LGBTQ + issues, and more—silently erasing vital knowledge that underpins scientific progress [1][2].

While some European institutions start backing up this data [3][4], the data rescue movement is driven by grassroots efforts like the Data Rescue Project and the Safeguarding Research initiative, who have mobilized volunteers, librarians, and scientists to download and archive these at-risk resources before they are lost forever.

I’m reaching out with an invitation to help organize an LMU OSC hackathon for building resilient research data rescue nodes that backup at-risk research data.

Content of one (or more) hackathon sessions could be:

- Installing a BitTorrent client on participants’ machines to begin seeding and safeguarding research datasets
- Repurposing old hardware—such as 2.5″ HDDs, Raspberry Pis, or laptops—by installing Linux and using them as dedicated rescue nodes
- Enhancing documentation and developing one-click installation scripts to make node deployment easy across systems
- For a more long-term vision of an autonomous, solar-powered HiveSeed that contains relevant world knowledge, take a look at this website: https://codeberg.org/nicebread/HiveSeed (But first steps first ;-)

If you're interested in shaping this hackathon — or just curious to learn more — let me know. We’re looking for people to help with coordination, logistics, outreach, and maybe even contribute a project idea or two.

Let’s work together to preserve scientific knowledge and build a resilient, community-powered data infrastructure.

Best,
Felix
