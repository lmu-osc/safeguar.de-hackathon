### Goals (for multiple hackathons)

1. Installing a BitTorrent client on participants’ machines to begin seeding and safeguarding research datasets. **Goal**: Increase the storage capacity of the torrent swarm
2. Repurposing old hardware—such as 2.5″ HDDs, Raspberry Pis, or laptops—by installing Linux and using them as dedicated rescue nodes
3. Enhancing documentation and developing one-click installation scripts to make node deployment easy across systems
4. Practice web scraping to rescue more data into the swarm.
5. Set up an independent SciOp instance at the LMU OSC
6. For a more long-term vision of an autonomous, solar-powered HiveSeed that contains relevant world knowledge, take a look at this website: [https://codeberg.org/nicebread/HiveSeed](https://codeberg.org/nicebread/HiveSeed) (But first steps first ;-))
