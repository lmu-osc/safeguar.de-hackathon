# Schedule for a 3-4h hackathon


- **16:00**: Welcome (5 min)
- **16:05**: *Why are we here?*: Ignition talk by Henrik SchÃ¶nemann (15 min) + Q&A (10 min)
- **16:30**: *Logistics: How to hackathon?* (20 min)
	- Show the set of (possible) goals (in Levels) and areas of contributions in an overview slide. Leave some open boxes where we can add more goals.
	- Explain tools/platforms to be used
- **16:50**: Short round of introductions (10 min), tell us: Your main interest, your area of expertise, where do you want to focus on?
	- Eventually add more goals to the overview.
- **17:00 - 18:30**: Form interest groups, start hacking!
	- Midway check-in after 45 min
	- Serve free pizza
- **18:30**: Wrap-up (30 min):
	- Teams report on their progress and left-over todos
	- Talk about next steps: Continue? Have another hackathon meeting? Work asynchronously in-between?
	- Collect the successes: 
    	- How many TB have effectively been added to the swarm, on how many nodes? How many more are within reach?
    	- Wbhat other contributions have been made?
    - Collect feedback on the hackathon: What worked well? What can be improved?


# Tasks / Contributions

- Gather abandoned hardware (RPis, laptops, external 2.5" HDDs, large 3.5" HDDs)
- Software development (mostly Linux / bash)
- Hardware knowledge, e.g. 
	- optimizing power consumption
	- A solar/battery setup
- Designing accessible documentation / tutorials (does not necessarily need technical knowledge; more creative and pedagogical skills)
- Outreach & community management


# Material that we need

- BYOD
- Old Raspberry Pis
- Old Micro-SD cards (at least 1 GB)
- Old external HDDs
- Old Laptops
- Many Cables: Micro-USB --> Mini-USB
- Power strips
  

# Caveat

- Can the RPis establish a WiFi connection to the LRZ network? Or maybe the BayernWLAN? -->
	- Beim LRZ ein Veranstaltungs-WLAN beantragen, mit Passwort.
