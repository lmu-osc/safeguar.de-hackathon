# Schedule for a 3-4h hackathon

-   **16:00**: Welcome (5 min)
-   **16:05**: *Why are we here?*: Ignition talk by Henrik SchÃ¶nemann (15 min) + Q&A (10 min)
-   **16:30**: *Logistics: How to hackathon?* (20 min)
    -   Show the set of (possible) goals (in levels) and areas of contributions in an overview slide. Leave some open boxes where we can add more goals.
    -   Explain tools/platforms to be used:
        -   Give a mini introduction to Bittorrent
        -   Show Sciop.net and how to use it
-   **16:50**: Short round of introductions (10 min), tell us: Your main interest, your area of expertise, where do you want to focus on?
    -   Eventually add more goals to the overview.
-   **17:00 - 18:30**: Form interest groups, start hacking!
    -   Midway check-in after 45 min
    -   Serve free pizza
-   **18:30**: Wrap-up (30 min):
    -   Teams report on their progress and left-over todos
    -   Talk about next steps: Continue? Have another hackathon meeting? Work asynchronously in-between?
    -   Collect the successes:
        -   How many terabytes have effectively been added to the swarm, on how many nodes? How many more are within reach?
        -   What other contributions have been made?
    -   Collect feedback on the hackathon: What worked well? What can be improved?
    -   Outlook: Show next steps (Sciop scraping / How to add new data sets; how to set up a SciOp instance at the LMU OSC; how to set up a solar-powered [HiveSeed](https://codeberg.org/nicebread/HiveSeed))

**Follow-up: Outreach**

-   Send followup [feedback survey](/Feedback_survey.md) to participants
-   Create an LMU Matrix channel?
-   Showcase projects and successes on social media

# Tasks / Contributions

-   Gather abandoned hardware (RPis, laptops, external 2.5" HDDs, large 3.5" HDDs) - do this *before* the hackathon
-   Software development (mostly Linux / bash)
-   Knowledge how to make mac Hardware capable to run Linux
-   Hardware knowledge, e.g.
    -   optimizing power consumption
    -   A solar/battery setup
-   Designing accessible documentation / tutorials (does not necessarily need technical knowledge; more creative and pedagogical skills)
-   Outreach & community management

# Material that we need

-   BYOD
-   Old Raspberry Pis
-   Old Micro-SD cards (at least 1 GB)
-   Old external HDDs
-   Old Laptops
-   Many Cables: Micro-USB --\> Mini-USB
-   Power strips
-   Tools (Mini-Screwdrivers)

# Caveat

-   Can the RPis establish a WiFi connection to the LRZ network? Or maybe the BayernWLAN? --\>
    -   Request a guest WiFi account for the hackathon
    -   Explain participants how they can connect their RPis to their home Wifi (when they take their device with them)
