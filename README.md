# safeguar.de hackathon
## A hackathon to build resilient research data rescue nodes that backup at-risk research data

The Trump administration has aggressively removed scientific and governmental research data from public access, purging thousands of web pages and datasets related to climate, health, demographics, LGBTQ + issues, and more — silently erasing vital knowledge that underpins scientific progress.

While some European institutions start backing up at-risk rsearch data, the data rescue movement is driven by grassroots efforts like the "Data Rescue Project" and the "Safeguarding Research" initiative, who have mobilized volunteers, librarians, and scientists to download and archive these resources before they are lost forever.

The LMU Open Science Center is running a hackathon where we support, hands-on, these data rescue projects.
