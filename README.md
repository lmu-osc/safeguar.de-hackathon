## A hackathon to build resilient research data rescue nodes that backup at-risk research data

The Trump administration has aggressively removed scientific and governmental research data from public access, purging thousands of web pages and datasets related to climate, health, demographics, LGBTQ + issues, and more — silently erasing vital knowledge that underpins scientific progress [[1]](https://www.ft.com/content/ccb0c850-f466-4b74-8c07-7d01230679a4) [[2]](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-data-hoarders-resisting-trumps-purge).

While some European institutions start backing up at-risk research data [[3]](https://www.uni-bremen.de/universitaet/hochschulkommunikation-und-marketing/pressemitteilungen/detailansicht/uni-bremen-und-awi-retten-wertvolle-wissenschaftliche-us-datenbanken) [[4]](https://absolutelymaybe.plos.org/2025/05/14/germanys-plan-for-an-open-and-independent-pubmed-safety-net/), the data rescue movement is driven by grassroots efforts like the [Data Rescue Project](https://www.datarescueproject.org) and the [Safeguarding Research](https://safeguar.de) initiative, who have mobilized volunteers, librarians, and scientists to download and archive these resources before they are lost forever.

The LMU Open Science Center is running a hackathon where we support, hands-on, the [safeguar.de](https://safeguar.de) project.

## 🚀 Join the LMU Open Science Center Hackathon

At this hands-on event, we will directly support these data rescue efforts. Here’s what we aim to do together:

- **Learn & Build**: Install a BitTorrent client on your own machine to seed and safeguard critical research datasets.
- **Repurpose Old Hardware**: Turn old 2.5" HDDs, Raspberry Pis, or laptops into dedicated data rescue nodes by installing Linux and setting up archiving tools.
- **Improve Tools & Docs**: Write better documentation and develop one-click installation scripts to simplify deployment on any system.

📅 Thursday, 7.8.2025, 16:00 - 19:00 

📍 Leopoldstr. 13, 80802 Munich, room 3322

## 🤝 Open to Everyone — Not Just Coders

While some parts are technical, we welcome everyone to contribute to: Outreach, Documentation, Coordination, Creative ideas.

*Let’s work together to preserve scientific knowledge and build a resilient, community-powered data infrastructure.*
