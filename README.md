## A hackathon to build resilient research data rescue nodes that backup at-risk research data

The Trump administration has aggressively removed scientific and governmental research data from public access, purging thousands of web pages and datasets related to climate, health, demographics, LGBTQ + issues, and more — silently erasing vital knowledge that underpins scientific progress [1][2].

While some European institutions start backing up at-risk research data [3][4], the data rescue movement is driven by grassroots efforts like the [Data Rescue Project](https://www.datarescueproject.org) and the [Safeguarding Research](https://safeguar.de) initiative, who have mobilized volunteers, librarians, and scientists to download and archive these resources before they are lost forever.

The LMU Open Science Center is running a hackathon where we support, hands-on, the [safeguar.de](https://safeguar.de) project.
